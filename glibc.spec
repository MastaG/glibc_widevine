# LGPLv2+ with exceptions is used for things that are linked directly

# Some other licenses are used in various places (BSD, Inner-Net,

#
# HSRL and FSFAP are only used in test cases, which currently do not
# ship in binary RPMs, so they are not listed here.  MIT is used for
# scripts/install-sh, which does not ship, either.
#
# GPLv3+ is used by manual/texinfo.tex, which we do not use.
#
# LGPLv3+ is used by some Hurd code, which we do not build.
#
# LGPLv2 is used in one place (time/timespec_get.c, by mistake), but
# it is not actually compiled, so it does not matter for libraries.

The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
Linux system will not function.
